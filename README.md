# CARG-TT Calculator 🧮

The **CARG-TT (Cancer and Aging Research Group - Toxicity Tool) Calculator** is a simple web-based application that helps assess the risk of chemotherapy-related toxicity in older adult cancer patients. It is based on the validated CARG model, which uses patient-specific clinical and functional variables to estimate risk levels.

## 🚀 Features

- User-friendly interface for data entry
- Risk scoring based on CARG methodology
- Output includes Total Risk Score and Risk Category (Low / Intermediate / High)
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile use

## 🧠 Background

The **CARG-TT model** helps oncologists and care teams make more informed treatment decisions for geriatric cancer patients. The tool incorporates multiple variables such as age, cancer type, renal function, falls history, hemoglobin, etc., to determine the patient’s risk of chemotherapy toxicity.

## ⚙️ How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in any web browser.
2. Fill in the required fields such as age, lab values, functional status, etc.
3. Click **Calculate** to view the total score and risk classification.
4. Use the result to guide clinical decisions in geriatric oncology care.

## 📊 Risk Levels (CARG Scoring)

- **Low Risk**: 0–5 points
- **Intermediate Risk**: 6–9 points
- **High Risk**: ≥10 points

*Note: These ranges may vary based on your implementation.*
